    /* Exaternal Libraries: Code that is outside of our project.
    Lets us share code
    helps save time and duplicating work. 
    
    Loading the external libraries using the modules.
    ESM Version
    ESM = EcmaScript Module (EcmaScript is another name for Js) 
    ESM Version: A version that works with Js Modules.
    
    Default Export: A simple and short way of exporting files in Js using modules. 
    We can only use ONE default export as default at a time from a file.
    
    MVC: Model - View -Controller (is a design pattern).
    Splits our code into 3 parts.
    1. model = saves and manages the data (cart.js)
    2. view = takes the data and displays it on the page. (renderOrderSummary())
    3. controller = runs some code when we interact with the page. (eventListeners in renderOrderSummary()). */
