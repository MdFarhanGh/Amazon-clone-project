    /*Promises: Is a class
      Better way to handle asynchronous code.
      similar to done() function in jasmine
      it lets us wait for some code to finish, before going to the next step.
      It has a parameter resolve. resolve is a function. Similar to done() function. It lets us control when to go to the next step.
      
    Why use promises?
      To avoid callback hell. which is nesting callbacks.
    
    Promise.all():
      Lets us run multiple promises at the same time and wait for all of them to finish.  */
