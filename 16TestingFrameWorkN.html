    /* Exaternal Libraries: Code that is outside of our project.
    Lets us share code
    helps save time and duplicating work. 
    
    Loading the external libraries using the modules.
    ESM Version
    ESM = EcmaScript Module (EcmaScript is another name for Js) 
    ESM Version: A version that works with Js Modules.
    
    Default Export: A simple and short way of exporting files in Js using modules. 
    We can only use ONE default export as default at a time from a file.
    
    MVC: Model - View -Controller (is a design pattern).
    Splits our code into 3 parts.
    1. model = saves and manages the data (cart.js)
    2. view = takes the data and displays it on the page. (renderOrderSummary())
    3. controller = runs some code when we interact with the page. (eventListeners in renderOrderSummary()).
    
    Mock: Create a fake version of the code in testing
    NOTE: while mocking a function, the order of the code matters.
    and a mock only lasts for 1 test.
    spyOn().and.callFake(() => {

    Integration test: Tests many units/piecies of code working together.
    }); 
    
    HOOKS: Lets us run some code for each test
    EX: beforeEach(function): runs code before "each" test.
    afterEach(): runs code after "each" test.
    beforeAll(): runs code before "all" test.
    afterAll(): runs code after "all" test.
