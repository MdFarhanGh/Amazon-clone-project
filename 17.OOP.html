    /* OOPS: Is another style of programming 
    Another way we write our code.
    Works by organizing our code into objects.
    Another reason is, It is easy to create multiple objects.
    
    Why use OOP?
      OOP Tries to represent the real world
      Here we try to represent the physical cart into a digital cart, where we can have different product. We also have actions in cart such as add a product, or remove a product from the cart.  */
