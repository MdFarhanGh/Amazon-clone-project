    /*Async await:
      Is a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code, built on top of Promises.
      It is a shortcut for promises.
      async:
        Used before a function
        It "always" returns a Promise
        You can use await only inside async functions
      await:
        lets us wait for a promise to finish, before going to the next line.
        Pauses execution until a Promise resolves
        Makes async code look synchronous
