  <!-- When we use script tags normally, it can cause naming conflicts which means once the variable has been created in any file, it cannot be used in any other file. Ex: cart and product variable.
  So to solve this we use modules.
  A module contains a variable inside a file so this variable will not cause conflicts with other variables in other file with the same name.Creating a Module...
  1. Create a file
  2. Don't load the file with <script>
  3. So, Any variable we create inside the file, will be contained inside the file. 
  Getting a variable out of a file.
  1. Add type='module' attribute: Let's this file get variables out of other files.
  2. export
  3. import. 
  NOTE: 
  1. Put all imports at the top of the file. 
  2. We need to use Live server. 
  Benefits of module.
  1. helps us avoid any naming conflict. (Still when using import, do not create the same variable again).
  2. We dont have to worry about the order of the file. 
  
  Notice that in cart.js we are not storing img, price, name of the product. We are just storing the productId and quantity. 
  So we can use this productId of each individual product to search in the product.js file and can get all the data that we need for the product. So there is no need to store the whole data in cart.js file once again.
  This is called Deduplicating data, or Normalizing the data. -->
