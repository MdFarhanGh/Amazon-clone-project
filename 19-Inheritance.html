    /*Inheritance: Lets us reuse code between classes.
    Ex: We have number of items that are listed on the amazon page  like, socks, basketball, t-shirts, toaster etc.
    But here t-shirt and toaster are different 'types' of products, like the t-shirt can have another property(value) like sizing.
    So one way to do is by creating a new Class Clothing that will have all the product properties along with its own property for sizing as well. This new class will inherit all the properties from its parent class.
    We use inheritance when one class is a more specific type of another class.
    
    super() is used in child class. It lets us call the constructor of the parent class. 
    
    Method Overriding: When we write something (methods) in parent class, and then re-define it in child class, it is called as method overiding,
    
    Polymorphism = (many forms) We use a method without knowing the class. Like we have exraInfoHTML, in both parent, and child class and it has 2 different forms in each. */
